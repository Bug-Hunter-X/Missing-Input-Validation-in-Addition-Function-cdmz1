This repository demonstrates a common error in Solidity: missing input validation. The `add` function lacks checks to ensure that the input values are indeed numbers. This can lead to issues such as unexpected results or even runtime errors if strings or other non-numeric types are passed as arguments.  The solution demonstrates how to add input validation to prevent these issues.
